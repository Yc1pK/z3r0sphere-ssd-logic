# z3r0sphere-ssd-logic

Spherical Kernel Logic for Embedded AI

A lightweight, hardware-friendly cosine-similarity kernel that projects vectors onto the unit sphere and computes their inner product. Ideal for edge-AI, firmware inference, and any resource-constrained environment.

⸻

Features
	•	Unit-sphere projection via efficient L2-normalization
	•	Cosine-similarity kernel k(x,y) = ⟨x/‖x‖,\,y/‖y‖⟩
	•	Zero matrix-kernel expansion — just dot products
	•	Handles high-dimensional embeddings with minimal drift
	•	ARM/NEON, SIMD, and AI-accelerator friendly
	•	Simple C and Python reference implementations included
